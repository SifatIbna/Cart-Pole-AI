*A pole is standing on a cart and The Task is to balance the pole by moving the cart right or left so that the pole doesn't fall and stays balanced*

To design this Algorithms i used

- Pytorch
- Gym
- CNN

This approach knows as Deep Q Network. The idea was Feeding each frame to the neural net and based on the Q values the Agent gradually learned how to balance the pole.

After training the Agent , he completely learned how to balance the pole.
